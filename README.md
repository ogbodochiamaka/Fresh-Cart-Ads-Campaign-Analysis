## Introduction:
This is an Excel project on the evaluation and optimization of different digital ad campaigns performance across various platforms and U.S. states. This project is to analyze return on ad spend (ROAS), improved conversions, efficient cost allocation, identify top-performing regions and channels to guide future ad spend and strategy decisions.
## Problem Statement:
- Which advertising platforms are delivering the highest conversion value and ROI?
- How does our conversion performance vary across different months and quarters?
- How much are we spending on each platform, and are we optimizing our ad budget effectively?
- What is our overall Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), and how profitable are our campaigns?
- Which states or regions are generating the highest conversion values?
- Which platforms are bringing in the most conversions, and how do they compare?
- What are our key engagement metrics (CTR, conversion rate, CPC), and what do they say about our campaign performance?
## Methodology:
To evaluate Fresh Cart Ads Campaign performance, the dataset was downloaded as csv file.
- Power query
- Power pivot
- Charts and Bar
- Multi-level filter system and intuitive layout
## Data Collection and Preparation:
- Imported raw datasets as CSV from Think Data Community
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query (removing duplicates, correcting data types, handling null values).
- Used Power Pivot to calculate measures and create custom metrics such as CTR, Cr, Total impression, ROAS, CPC etc. 
## Reporting and Visualization:
- Built PivotTables and Pivot Charts for interactive reporting.
- Enabled slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
## Visualization:
This interactive Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of digital ad performance across multiple platforms and U.S. states. It delivers data-driven insights into conversion value, advertising cost, platform efficiency, and regional impact, empowering marketing teams to make informed, ROI-focused decisions

## Analysis:
## Which advertising platforms are delivering the highest conversion value and ROI?
- YouTube delivered the highest conversion value at $29,457.67, followed by Twitter ($28,059.71) and Facebook ($21,502.09).
- In terms of cost vs. value, YouTube also had the lowest ad spend ($2,268), indicating the highest ROI among platforms.
- The overall ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is 3, meaning the company earns $3 for every $1 spent on ads.
## How does our conversion performance vary across different months and quarters?
#### Monthly Conversion Value Trend:
- Peaks in May ($26,000) and March ($17,000) 
- Dips in January, April, and August.
#### Quarterly Conversion Value:
- Q2 (April–June): $44,913.34 – highest
- Q3 (July–Sept): $27,258.70
- Q1 (Jan–Mar): $25,345.25
### Key Insight: 
Conversion value is highest in Q2, suggesting strong seasonal performance in mid-year months.
## How much are we spending on each platform, and are we optimizing our ad budget effectively?
#### Cost by Platform:
- Facebook: $9,359.00
- Twitter: $6,678.00
- Instagram: $5,467.00
- Google Ads: $4,725.00
- YouTube: $2,268.00

Facebook has the highest cost ($9,359) but ranks third in conversion value ($21,502). On the other hand, YouTube has the lowest cost ($2,268) but the highest conversion value ($29,457). While Facebook ads consume the most budget, they don’t deliver proportionate conversion value. A strategic reallocation of the ad budget to more effective platforms like YouTube and Twitter could improve overall ROAS.
## What is our overall Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), and how profitable are our campaigns?
- Total Conversion Value: $97,517.30
- Total Cost: $28,497.00
- ROAS: 3
### Key Insight: 
The campaigns are profitable, with $3 in revenue for every $1 spent.
## Which states or regions are generating the highest conversion values?
### Top 5 States by Conversion Value:
- Georgia: $19,586.82
- California: $18,909.24
- Washington: $16,514.90
- Florida: $12,270.46
- Texas: $9,650.64

The top-performing states in conversion value are Georgia, California, and Washington and marketing efforts could be expanded in these regions. Some states contribute significantly to the total conversion value, while others might be underperforming.
## Which platforms are bringing in the most conversions, and how do they compare?
### Conversions by Platform:
- YouTube: 835
- Facebook: 561
- Twitter: 470
- Instagram: 209
- Google Ads: 135

YouTube leads both in conversion count and value, reinforcing it as the top-performing platform overall.
## What are our key engagement metrics (CTR, conversion rate, CPC), and what do they say about our campaign performance?
- CTR (Click-Through Rate): 0.15% – Low, suggests low ad engagement.
The CTR is only 0.15%, meaning a very small percentage of impressions convert into clicks. This implies that ads may not be engaging or well-targeted. With 23,401,441 impressions but only 35,404 clicks, ad creatives or audience targeting strategies may need improvement to increase engagement and drive more traffic.
- Conversion Rate: 6% – Strong, indicates a good rate of converting clicks to sales.
Out of 35,404 clicks, only 2,210 conversions were achieved, resulting in a conversion rate of just 6%.  A significant number of users are clicking the ads but not converting. This suggests potential issues with landing pages, ad messaging, or audience targeting, which need to be optimized for better performance.
- CPC (Cost Per Click): $0.80 – Reasonable, especially considering high ROAS.
### Key Insight:
While CTR is low, the conversion rate and ROAS are strong, indicating that ads are effectively converting the few who engage
## Recommendation:
- Reallocate more budget to YouTube to maximize ROI and conversion impact.
- Audit Facebook campaigns to improve targeting and reduce underperforming ad spend.
- Target these states with more localized or personalized ad content to further boost performance.
- Align future major campaigns with Q2 periods and analyze what drives May’s success to replicate it.
